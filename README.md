# Hospital Mortality Investigation 
CPSC 392 - Data Science Final Project: Hospital Mortality 

Our group wanted to investigate what predictors or health conditions can lead to in-hospital mortality, and provide recommendations/inform healthcare professionals about these vital signs. Our dataset had originally had 51 variables and 428 datapoints. Dataset was provided via Kaggle.

# Questions Investigated
1) What are the most common health conditions that lead to in-hospital mortality?
2) When considering features BMI, glucose, and urine output, what clusters may emerge and how can we characterize those clusters?
3) Are there any differences in the predictive performance of a model in pre- dicting hospital mortality specifically across different subgroups of patients, such as patients who are diagnosed with depression or other medical conditions or diseases (renal failure, diabetes, hypertensive)? With these sub-groups of patients, how more or less likely will these patients face hospital mortality?
4) How does the mean absolute error differ between the train and test data when using Principal Component Analysis on all continuous variables, and retaining enough Principle Components to keep 90% of the variance, to predict hospital mortality with our model(s)? How will creating prinici- pal components give us more understanding of the structure of data and magnitude of influences that different variables may hold?
5) Out of the 48 variables observed in the dataset (excluding ground and ID), how can we utilize the Regularization method LASSO to select which variables have the most impact in predicting hospital mortality?
6) How can healthcare providers and policymakers use the results of this study to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs?
